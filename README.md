# Bridgetown with Vue

This is quick example on how to integrate [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) components in [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) layouts.

This repository is based on the default Bridgetown setup created with ``bridgetown new <name>``. The changes I introduced to add Vue support are:

- webpack.config.js (line 4, 22, 33, 56)
- package.json (dependencies)
- frontend/javascript/index.js
- frontend/components/Hello.vue
- src/\_layouts/default.liquid (line 10)
